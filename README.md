# Student-Faculty-Interaction

The platform provides real time coverage of the topics being taught in the lectures with student's ability to rate the topics on the basis of their understanding. Faculty can view the ratings of the class as an aggregate. Students and Faculty can set up meetings with each other and can recieve notifications.
